<h1><b><u></u></b></h1> 
<p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes </p>

<h1><b><u></u></b></h1>
 <p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</p>
  
<h1><b><u></u></b></h1>    
 <p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
  
  <h1><b><u></u></b></h1>
  <p style="color:white; font fanily:Berlin Sans FB">
Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
    
 <h1><b><u></u></b></h1>    
 <p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
   
 <h1><b><u></u></b></h1>    
 <p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
    
<h1><b><u></u></b></h1>    
 <p style="color:black; font-family:Berlin Sans FB"><span style="background-color:cyan;">  And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you</span>
   
  <h1><b><u></u></b></h1>    
 <p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
   
   <h1><b><u></u></b></h1>    
 <p style="color:white; font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
