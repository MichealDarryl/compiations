      <h4><p style="color:pur; font family:Berlin Sans FB">
All my friends are heathens, take it slow<br>
Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>
Please don't make any sudden moves<br>
You don't know the half of the abuse<br></h4>
    
  <h1></h1>
        <h4><p style="color:black; font family:Berlin Sans FB">
All my friends are heathens, take it slow <br>
Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>

      <h1></h1>
          <h4> <p style="color:black; font family:Berlin Sans FB">
Welcome to the room of people<br>
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day<br>
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door<br>
Doesnt mean our brains will change from hand grenades<br>

            <h1></h1>
   <h4> <p style="color:black; font family:Berlin Sans FB">
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you<br>
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you<br>
You'll think,How'd I get here, sitting next to you?<br>
But after all, I've said, please don't forget<br></h4></span>

      <h1></h1>
    <h4> <p style="color:black; font family:Berlin Sans FB">
We don't deal with outsiders very well<br>
They say newcomers have a certain smell<br>
You have trust issues, not to mention<br>
They say they can smell your intentions<br>
You'll never know the freakshow sitting next to you<br>
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you<br>
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"<br>
But after all I've said, please don't forget<br></h4>

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed"<br>    
(It's blasphemy)<br>
I tried to warn you just to stay away<br>
(Away)<br>
And now they're outside ready to bust<br>
(To bust)<br>
It looks like you might be one of us<br></h4>
